# Fast-Legendre-Transform
Computation of the Legendre Transform with Associated Legendre Functions as basis functions. 

Implementation of the algorithm given in "Fast Algorithms for Spherical Harmonic Transforms" - Mark Tygert and Vladimir Ronkhlin.  Open the 'main.m' file and read the comments to run the case. The computation of the Chebyshev has been done using the Naive- matrix multiplication method. The Lower order and the Higher order Associated legendre functions are computed using direct matrix multiplications, instead they need to be computed using the "Fast Multipole Method".
